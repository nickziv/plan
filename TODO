SPLIT:
make a "split" command, which copies the activities in the specified day into
the specified date.

if just a date arg is specified, the weekday is copied into the date.

Will not overwrite data in <date> unless forced (-f).

plan split [-f] sun <date> /* makes date identical to sunday */

plan split [-f] <date> /* makes date identical to whatever day <date> is in the */
		  /* calendar */

COPY:
similar to split, but can only copy from day to day or date to date.

Will not overwrite data in <to_da*> unless forced (-f).

plan copy [-f] <from_day> <to_day>
plan copy [-f] <from_date> <to_date>
