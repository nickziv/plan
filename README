plan is a light weight time management system for the command line.

UPDATE: This project is currently on life-support. Due to a multitude of
youthful mistakes, coupled with extreme impatience the project's code is a
total mess. It is unstable to use, and needs to be refactored. Even though I
use it personally, I discourage everyone else from using it, until I've fixed
some issues. Currently, the code needs to be changed, to be less stupid. For
example:

	1) Should stop using the file system as a data base.  It's slow, buggy,
	and not portable (only works on Illumos/Solaris).

	2) The entire code base looks like spaghetti. It should look more like
	lasagna.

	3) There is much more, but it's not worth mentioning here.
